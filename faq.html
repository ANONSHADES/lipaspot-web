        <span class="arrow">â–¶</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Lipaspot is a fintech software solution designed to help businesses, particularly those in the service industry, manage their payments and operations with greater efficiency and convenience. Our system automates M-Pesa payment confirmation and staff-level transaction tracking, streamlining daily tasks for both managers and employees.

      <div class="faq-question">
        <span>How does Lipaspot confirm M-Pesa payments?</span>
        <span class="arrow">â–¶</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        When a customer makes a payment to your business's M-Pesa till, the Lipaspot software, which is configured on a PDQ machine, captures the payment confirmation message. It then instantly broadcasts this message to the relevant attendants, waiters, or cashiers on their mobile devices, ensuring on-the-spot verification and eliminating manual checks.

        <span class="arrow">â–¶</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Our system allows the staff member who served the customer to "claim" the transaction directly on their phone. This simple action links the specific M-Pesa payment to the individual employee, ensuring accurate tracking of who handled which sale.

        At the end of a shift, our software automatically generates a detailed report for each individual attendant, waiter, or cashier based on the transactions they have claimed. This automated calculation provides a clear and accurate summary of their performance, making the reconciliation process quick, easy, and transparent for both staff and management.
